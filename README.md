# FMindex implementation using wavet trees

### Goals
  1. implement the simplest FM-index using just basic data structures
  2. implement FM-index using wavelet trees

### How to get source
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/iborko/fmindex`

### Build instructions
  * run `make`
  * executables will be located in `bin` folder (`bin/fmindex`, `bin/test`)

### Usage
TODO
